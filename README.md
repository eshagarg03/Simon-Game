# Simon-Game
A digital recreation of the classic Simon game to test and improve memory and attention skills

Simon is a game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

The Game has 4 colored buttons (Green, Red, Yellow, Blue) that can be pressed by the player.
Each button will have their own distinct sound.
When a button is pressed, the button will light up indicating it is active.
After each successful round, the sequence gets more complex.
The player losses when a wrong button is pressed and the game is restarted.
